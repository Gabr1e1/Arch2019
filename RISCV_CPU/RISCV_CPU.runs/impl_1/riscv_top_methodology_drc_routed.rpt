2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
SYNTH-6#1 Warning
Timing of a block RAM might be sub-optimal  
The timing for the instance ram0/ram_bram/ram_reg_1_2, implemented as a block RAM, might be sub-optimal as no output register was merged into the block
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-6#2 Warning
Timing of a block RAM might be sub-optimal  
The timing for the instance ram0/ram_bram/ram_reg_1_3, implemented as a block RAM, might be sub-optimal as no output register was merged into the block
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#1 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on Rx relative to clock(s) sys_clk_pin
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#2 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on btnC relative to clock(s) sys_clk_pin
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#3 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on Tx relative to clock(s) sys_clk_pin
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#4 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on led relative to clock(s) sys_clk_pin
Related violations: <none>
