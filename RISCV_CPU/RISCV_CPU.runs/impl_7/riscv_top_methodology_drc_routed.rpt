TIMING-6#1 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_out1_clk_wiz_0 and clk_out1_clk_wiz_0_1 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware.

There is a large setup violation of -6.244 ns between cpu0/id_ex0/ex_reg2_reg[3]/C (clocked by clk_out1_clk_wiz_0) and cpu0/id_ex0/ex_reg1_reg[12]/D (clocked by clk_out1_clk_wiz_0_1). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>
